# Laravel5 API Generator

I am fan of creating APIs. Laravel provides really good and handy commands to setup your all required files like Controller, Model, Migration etc.

But you need to generate it step by step. so it was little bit time consuming for me to create those all things to setup basic CRUD api for one module and repeat the same steps again for the new model.

So I have created a command where you just need to add fields as you are adding when creating migration and all your rest things are created automatically and placed in your configured folders with given namespaces as well.

This command Generator generates following things:
  - Migration File
  - Model
  - Repository (optional)
  - Controller
  - updated routes.php

So your simple CURD API is ready in less than 1 minute.

Code and full documentation is coming soon. Hit the star button and Stay tuned !! :)
